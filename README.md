# haix-react-query

notes: 
- I was playing around with react query and tried two different ways to pass data. The profile query was the first approach, the second approach, I refactored the stats query into a custom hook. I decided to leave both. 
- Thankyou for the challenge, it pushed me to spend some time with react-query which I was interested in learning.
